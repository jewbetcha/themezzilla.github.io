title: Mid Summer Update
---

It seems like summer is flying by, as August is approaching quite quickly. I haven't written in a month, so here are some things that I've been thinking about. Not really in any particular order or genre.

I started work on a project with one of my best friends Max, and a really smart friend of his, Jake,  who's an aspiring web guy as well. So far it has been awesome, and I have enjoyed having something cool and different going on outside of work. I have had the chance to be around some seriously smart people, and contribute to an idea that could change the world (seriously!). Jake and I will be charged with creating the site for the project, which I know will be SICK. I can't wait to work on it and have it done for everyone to see. Even if the project ends there, it's gonna be an amazing experience.

After just over one month with my Pebble Time, I have a solid verdict: it's aight. Some of the novelty wore off after about week two or maybe 1.5. I have however, had a handful of times where I was happy to have it. For example: I was biking around and drinking on the 4th of July, and having the Pebble allowed me to monitor my phone with ease while at the same time save lots of (phone) battery by not having to check it all the damn time. Also, the Time battery is just obscene, it never runs out. With all that being said, the majority of my time is spent either at work, at home, or at the gym. Two out of three of those locations I essentially don't need my watch for the time or the notifications, and the third I really don't want a watch at all. It feels like since it's a smartwatch I should be using it ALL the time, but I'm really not. It's mostly a watch.

There have been a good number of ups and downs this summer, but I like where things are going at the moment. I'm really enjoying being active on coding projects outside of work, I needed that. For the time being, I'm going to keep grindin on the keyboard, keep grindin in the gym, and enjoy the final weeks of summer.

Cheers

Coleman
