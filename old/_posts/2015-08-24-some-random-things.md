title: Some Random Things
---

Ahhh what do I even talk about here? So much has been happening, this might have been the busiest summer ever! Today there was a serious hint of fall in the air. I think it really means summer is coming to a close...

Some coding things I've been doing - I used a python script to hack the OnePlus Two invite waiting list. So far they haven't kicked me off and if they ever actually send out some invitations I might even get one! If not though, I'm going with the MotoX which comes out really soon actually. I finally finished up a freelance project that was dragging on forEVERRRR. Thankfully everyone ended up happy and the site actually turned out alright. I will be starting another bigger project pretty soon here for my uncle, it should be a good learning experience and I'll be doing it in Jekyll! The project I'm working on with Max and Jake is really starting to take shape. We'll find out soon if we made it to the Kairos convention where we can show Trunk to everyone. Work started this week on the new website, I think it's going to be awesome :)

Still on the job hunt. Man is it a GRIND! I have however, learned a huge amount of new things throughout the whole process, and I think it's been overall a good experience. Not only that, I've been pushed outside my boundaries with some coding challenges, and have put up good showings for each one. Just gotta keep on keepin on.
