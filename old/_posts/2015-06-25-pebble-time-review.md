It's finally here! After waiting SO LONG for my Pebble Time, my Kickstarter project has arrived. So far, I really love having the watch, and I'll be updating my experiences with it here in this post.

Thoughts after one day: It's seriously a great watch. It's comfortable, attractive to look at, and has a nice and slim/light feel on my arm. So far, a very well designed piece of hardware. My initial feelings on the UI are pretty positive. Everything is snappy and quick, while the animations are smooth and I really don't mind them at all, especially because there is a small animation for just about everything you do with the Time. I've been changing my watch face about every two hours, just because there are so many good ones. I go back and forth between attractive, simple faces with just the time, to complex and geeky ones that give you tons of info like weather and battery charge. The screen is a little tough to get used to. It is admittedly dim indoors, but I haven't had any instances where I had to strain to read what was on it. Outside in the sun it's simply stunning. I love looking at it outside. The coolest thing I did today on my Time was when I was receiving some group texts, and I was able to quickly respond with a custom entry of "Word" to a message. I was able to do this in mere seconds, while waiting at a stoplight in my car. Really cool, love that. I'm excited to use it some more.

Thoughts after three days: I still really enjoy the Pebble Time, everything I said before is still true. I'm a big fan of not having to take out my phone every time I want to check a notification, and the vibration on the Time is always noticable right away. I ended up muting notifications for apps that I can't interact with on the time however, such as Snapchat and Instagram. I played around with some new straps as well, I have a NATO on there right now which I really like (however the stock strap is really nice).

I do have a couple gripes: if you're on your phone when you get a notification, even if you dismiss it on there, you still have to dismiss it on the Time as well (or wait for it to go away). Also, if you dismiss a text (or any notification) right away, there's no way of intacting with it later. So if you don't respond to something immedeately, you're going to have to use your phone. I also wish there was a "do not disturb" mode that you could set for a period of time, or indefinitely. Take today for example: I was in a coding workshop all day, where I had a laptop and my phone right in front of me. Every time I got a notification, my phone AND my Time would buzz, and I'd have to dismiss it on each device (not mandatory, but I'm weird about that). That was a little annoying. I'm hopeful that all of these small inconveniences will be solved by later software updates from the Pebble team.

Thats it until next time!
